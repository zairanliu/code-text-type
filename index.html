                        I was invited by Katrin Mayer to join in the
                        investigation of her speculative question of what a
                        feminist perspective on code might look like. We began
                        collaboratively researching into internet history and
                        were especially interested in thinking about where code
                        came from, how it was made, how it looked and what it
                        could look like. Code, computing and programming are of
                        course inextricably linked to the history of technology
                        and the people who operated it; turns out, they were
                        women. Conditioned to think of computing as a
                        predominantly male domain, we were fascinated to learn
                        of its female origins thanks to excellent research done
                        on this topic in recent years, and are excited to see
                        how a feminist rewriting of computing history is well
                        under way today.

     Computer has two separate yet related meanings. A computer, from the early
          17th century and up until the first half of the 20th century, 
          referred to “someone who computes.” It was a person whom, by hand, 
          performed time-consuming and tedious mathematical calculations. As the 
          work of such Computers was akin to secretarial work, it was 
          often the work of women.

                        “computing” was the Analytical Engine by Charles Babbage
                        . He is widely credited as the inventor of the machine
                        (the hardware, though a term coined much later) while
                        his associate, mathematician and Computer Ada Lovelace,
                        was the brilliant mind that conceived of its algorithms
                        (what we now call software), left unrecognized for a
                        century.

     The Analytical Engine would never be completed, but it represents the
          conceptual dawn of the computer age. (...) the strikingly 
          original notes that Ada prepared to explain this new kind of machine 
          would presage the literature of computer science by nearly 
          a century. To demonstrate how the engine could calculate Bernoulli 
          Numbers without any assistance from a “human hand or head,” 
          she wrote mathemathical proofs that many scholars characterize as 
          the first computer programs ever written

                        But the Analytical Engine was yet too far ahead of its
                        time, and while more efforts were made to invent
                        technology that would aid in computing, data had to be
                        processed and calculated painstakingly by hand. The
                        fields of mathematics, astronomy and physics were
                        dependant on the work of human Computers, many of them
                        women. There was a widespread biologistical belief that
                        the meticulousness and patience necessary to doing this
                        kind of work were supposedly inherent “female” traits,
                        “women’s work.” Though it enabled women to enter the
                        workforce and strive toward some level of independence,
                        the female prevalence in these jobs was in truth mostly
                        due to the fact that they were paid much lower wages. It
                        was when computing power was measured in “kilo girls”:
                        1000 hours of (female) computing labour.

    These women quite literally mapped the cosmos, but their wages were 
          equivalent to those of unskilled workers (...), they 
          earned barely more than they would have if they’d worked in a factory.

    Female hands lifted from pencils and slide rules to desk calculators
           and switches, then relays and punch card tabulators.
           Coaxing information into and out of the new machines was
           considered a woman’s job, too, on the level with typing, 
           filing documents, and patching phone calls from place to place.

    (...) For a few centuries, groups of women working in hives and “harems”
              were the hardware (...). It’s the accumulation of all 
              those steps, executed simultaneously and collectively, that prefigured
              our connected, caclulating, big-data world. Alone, women 
              were the first computers; together, they formed the first information 
              networks. (...) Long before we came to understand the
              network as an extension of ourselves, our great-grandmothers were performing
              the functions that brought about its existence.

                        working intimately with text-as-data. The way code looks
                        until this day has its origin here: “Typing” meant using
                        machinery that by its design determined its
                        characteristic visuality.

                        In the beginning, typewriters did not differentiate
                        between the widths of individual letters, and thus each
                        letter was printed with the same width. This meant that
                        some particularly wide letters (like the m and most
                        uppercase letters) had to be squeezed to fit the space,
                        and others (such as i, l, I) had to be modified to fill
                        out more space, as to not cause too many gaps in the
                        text.

                        The necessary letter modifications resulted in a new
                        genre of monospaced typefaces. They turned out to be
                        particularly useful for clearly distinguishing letters,
                        for writing data in an orderly manner, and for helping

                        vital when writing and reading code, and so this choice
                        of typeface has prevailed in programming until today.

                        invented software programming.

    No one really knew how to program the room-sized machine – the only thing
              that existed were the wiring diagrams representing the
              physical layout of the machine. (...) As programming languages did
              not yet exist, they then physically wired the program by
              fixing cables and flicking the machine’s switches in the sequences
              they had developed. The positions of those switches and
              cables were the program. By training themselves to program the ENIAC,
              they invented and developed major computing concepts which
              are still widely used by programmers today, such as nested loops
              for example.

              programming. A 1946 New York Times article announcing the “amazing machine,”

    Grace Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist known for
            popularizing the idea that programming languages could be independent from
            machines, and that an English-based language was possible. (...) She
            recalls: “(...) It’s much easier for most people to write an English
            statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to
            be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would
            translate them into machine code. (...) I would say ‘Subtract income tax
            from pay’ instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds
            of symbols.”

                        Programming today carries her legacy. First and foremost, code is a
                        language, with syntax and grammar and vocabulary, plus some logic. We can
                        invent code much like a sentence, choosing the words that fit best. Code
                        is text both in the sense that it is composed by letters and that it can
                        be written and read.

                        <br>
                        When thinking about Hoppers legacy, language and the
                        readabilitiy of code, one might ask: Who actually reads the code? In the
                        case of this website, I write code for the browser to read, interpret,
                        execute. The browser is my audience. And not only does it speak a
                        different language, it has a wholly different way of reading. Did you know
                        that spaces take browsers just the same time to read as actual letters?
                        Every glyph typed – even if it is a blank space – results in information
                        stored, and corresponds to storage space or file size. This is why proper
                        programmers storetheircodewithoutspaces. The absence of a letter is not
                        nothing, blank space not 0.

                        some symbolic and syntactical conventions, browsers would quite simply not

                        which symbol is used. But this information is manifested as letters of a
                        certain shape; they are not only read but seen, too. Every text needs a

                        Early typewriters usually came with one typeface built right into the
                        machine. The introduction of changeable typefaces moved the typewriter one
                        step closer to becoming a modern productive word processor and precursor
                        of today’s desktop computers.

                        of the first machines where fonts could be switched easily and characters
                        could be stored on a magnetic band, making it thus an important bridge
                        technology between typewriter and computer.

     At the physical heart of the Selectric typewriter’s innovation was a golf-ball-shaped type head that replaced the 
              conventional typewriter’s basket of type bars. The design eliminated the bane of rapid typing: 
              jammed type bars. And with no bars to jam, typists’ speed and productivity soared. 
              
     One other innovation in the design—a changeable typeface—was borrowed from a turn-of-the-century model, the Blickensderfer 
              typewriter. (...) By making the golf ball interchangeable, the Selectric enabled different fonts, 
              including  italics, scientific notation and other languages, to be swapped in. With the addition in 1964 of 
              a magnetic tape system for storing characters, the Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST) model 
              became the first, albeit analog, word-processor device. Less well-known is the Selectric typewriter’s role 
              as one of the first computer terminals. (...) A modified version of the Selectric, dubbed the IBM 2741 
              Terminal, was adapted to plug into the System/360, and enabled a wider range of engineers and researchers to
              begin talking to and interacting with their computers.

                        Dual Basic was one of the many typefaces available for the Selectric. I
                        liked the typeface for its openness and clarity; also, it lacks the usual
                        modifications done on monospaced typefaces to fill visual holes. It is
                        almost like a text typeface only with equalized widths; it seemed like an
                        interesting in-between, unsure of which technology or age to belong to.

                        I found that in my investigation into all this, the harder I looked, the
                        blurrier the lines became between coding, writing and typing. Might the
                        distinction between them be simply determined by my choice of typeface and
                        machinery? For coding, I use a code editor and a monospaced font, because
                        it is easier for reading text that is code. For writing, I use a
                        proportionally spaced typeface, because it is easier for reading text that
                        is not code. In both cases, I press buttons, I type. The typeface you are
                        reading and seeing now is Coda, designed as part of this project. It is
                        based on the framework of Dual Basic and modified in two directions: In
                        one, whitespace is taken out, and the monospaced becomes proportional,
                        much nicer for reading this text right now. In the other direction,
                        fictional serifs are added, to transform it into a fully functional coding
                        typeface. Every letter and every way a letter’s line is made, drawn,
                        chiseled or printed has a historical and technological provenance. Today,
                        typefaces are produced digitally; they are software, they are code, thus
                        themselves written and composed of text. We can think about variables,
                        interaction, output. Code is text is type is font is code?

     Something happened to the generation of programmers after Grace Hopper
              and her peers. Although (...) women were being encouraged 
              to pursue programming as an alternative to secretarial work, the 
              field was quickly becoming far less welcoming to women than
              it had been even a decade before. (...) Instead of running departments 
              and advancing their art, they were starting to cluster “at 
              the lower end of the occupational pool” (...).

                        Let me tie at least one of many loose ends here. You may rightfully
                        wonder: what happened to women programmers? Why is the image we have of a
                        programmer today automatically, reflexively, that of a man? I have
                        mentioned the wage discrimination that had been structurally present from
                        the moment women entered the modern workforce. There was also an
                        unwillingness by computer companies to provide models of work that would
                        help to balance childcare with a career. And as computing developed into
                        an increasingly important and profitable industry, the image, value and
                        requirements of the profession changed profoundly. A conference held in
                        1968 to address the so-called “software crisis” (a consequence of
                        programming’s difficulty to keep up with ever accelerating technological
                        progress) initiated a movement to re-brand programming as “software
                        engineering.” What sounds like a merely semantic change would however come
                        to have far-reaching implications, determining who could gain access to
                        the field and who couldn’t.

     As such, it would be treated like a branch of engineering (...). This change signaled a larger 
              renegotiation of computing’s professional status that would unfold through 
              professional journals and societies, hiring practices, and certification programs throughout 
              the 1960s and 1970s. The more the discipline professionalized, the more it 
              grew implicitly masculine. The introduction of formal educational prerequisites for programming
               jobs, for example, made it harder for self-taught programmers to find employment – 
               a change that penalized female candidates, particularly those who might have taken time off 
               from school to raise children, above all. If computing “began as women’s work,”
               writes historian Nathan Ensmenger, “it had to be made masculine.”

                        Women faded from the profession. They were never truly gone, but harder to
                        be found. There were still women where networks were formed; hypertexts
                        created; knowledge organised; search engines built; message boards hosted;
                        connections drawn... But the landscape of computing, and the idea of what
                        it represents and how it’s represented, changed to such an extent that
                        female contributions were in many parts forgotten. This is of course an
                        incomplete history, told subjectively through the lens of Katrins and my
                        research, the books we read, the course of our conversations, personal
                        interests and own experiences. I never had or knew of female programmer
                        role models. The suggestion to code my own website and not use Geocities
                        for the homepage of my email writing club came from my stepfather, a
                        software engineer, and sparked my fascination with what pure text can
                        create. Though off to an early start, programming was never in the realm
                        of what I considered for my professional future, because I simply never
                        knew that someone like me could be doing something like that. It took me a
                        long time to realize that if I wanted to see it, I needed to be it – or at
                        least try to. I am happy to see more women, now; again. This research has
                        been instrumental in discovering somewhat of a 1ineage.

                        called HTML. It is especially prone to endless fractal-like nesting of
                        elements inside and alongside one another. Structures are built with a

                        childrenNodes, siblings(), nextSibling, parentNode, parent(), parents(),
                        parentsUntil(), gparent(), just to name a few. This is what it looks like:

                        Thankfully, we do not write code on empty sheets of paper anymore. We use
                        code editors; fancy text programs that do all kinds of things to help find
                        our way in the matrix. There, lines have proven to be the most efficient
                        crumbs for finding back, connecting beginnings and ends. Looking at our
                        digital interfaces, lines often signal traces back to an origin, to the
                        first element, post, tweet or email.

                        We were also reminded of the warps in fabrics, vertically structuring a
                        textile piece that back in the day might have been programmed by
                        punchcards, ancestors to the code written here. The lines you can see on
                        this website visualise how the code of this website looks in the moment of
                        coding it. Its design mirrors its code, shows the process, reveals its own
                        making, in a way. Lines have a way of accumulating the more we write, the
                        deeper we dig and the longer we go. It means something is building:
                        software, patterns, conversations, layers, story. These lines we can
                        create ourselves; they make a structure that we can use to crawl in
                        between hierarchies and chronologies; and they are the scaffold this
                        website, this text, this story builds on.
