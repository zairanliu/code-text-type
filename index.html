                        I was invited by Katrin Mayer to join in the
                        investigation of her speculative question of what a
                        feminist perspective on code might look like. We began
                        collaboratively researching into internet history and
                        were especially interested in thinking about where code
                        came from, how it was made, how it looked and what it
                        could look like. Code, computing and programming are of
                        course inextricably linked to the history of technology
                        and the people who operated it; turns out, they were
                        women. Conditioned to think of computing as a
                        predominantly male domain, we were fascinated to learn
                        of its female origins thanks to excellent research done
                        on this topic in recent years, and are excited to see
                        how a feminist rewriting of computing history is well
                        under way today

      Computer has two separate yet related meanings. A computer, from the early
      17th century and up until the first half of the 20th century, referred 
      to “someone who computes.” It was a person whom, by hand, performed time-consuming 
      and tedious mathematical calculations. As the work of such Computers was
      akin to secretarial work, it was often the work of women.

        The Analytical Engine would never be completed, but it represents the
        conceptual dawn of the computer age. (...) the strikingly original notes
        that Ada prepared to explain this new kind of machine would presage the
        literature of computer science by nearly a century. To demonstrate how the
        engine could calculate Bernoulli Numbers without any assistance from a
        “human hand or head,” she wrote mathemathical proofs that many scholars
        characterize as the first computer programs ever written (...) she was the
        first to consider that a machine could have applications beyond pure
        calculations (...)

      But the Analytical Engine was yet too far ahead of its time, and while
      more efforts were made to invent technology that would aid in computing,
      data had to be processed and calculated painstakingly by hand. The fields
      of mathematics, astronomy and physics were dependant on the work of human
      Computers, many of them women. There was a widespread biologistical belief
      that the meticulousness and patience necessary to doing this kind of work
      were supposedly inherent “female” traits, “women’s work.” Though it
      enabled women to enter the workforce and strive toward some level of
      independence, the female prevalence in these jobs was in truth mostly due
      to the fact that they were paid much lower wages. It was when computing
      power was measured in “kilo girls”: 1000 hours of (female) computing
      labour.

    Female hands lifted from pencils and slide rules to desk calculators and
    switches, then relays and punch card tabulators. Coaxing information into
    and out of the new machines was considered a woman’s job, too, on the level
    with typing, filing documents, and patching phone calls from place to place.

      Typewriters, switchboards, computers: As women were seen as mere
      “operators” of machines, their work was assumed to be “more handicraft
      than science” and thus “more mechanical than intellectual” 6. However, the
      true merit of their work was just harder to spot than the more tangible
      developments in engineering, a field mainly dominated by men. These
      womens’ lasting accomplishment was in fact running, performing, and
      virtually embodying what was becoming a global informational
      infrastructure.

    (...) For a few centuries, groups of women working in hives and “harems”
    were the hardware (...). It’s the accumulation of all those steps, executed
    simultaneously and collectively, that prefigured our connected, caclulating,
    big-data world. Alone, women were the first computers; together, they formed
    the first information networks. (...) Long before we came to understand the
    network as an extension of ourselves, our great-grandmothers were performing
    the functions that brought about its existence.

      I thought about how what I am seeing while programming this website might
      relate to the work these women were doing. Using technology, virtual
      models of thinking, working intimately with text-as-data. The way code
      looks until this day has its origin here: “Typing” meant using machinery
      that by its design determined its characteristic visuality.
      <img src="image/fig-6.jpg" alt="" />
      In the beginning, typewriters did not differentiate between the widths of
      individual letters, and thus each letter was printed with the same width.
      This meant that some particularly wide letters (like the m and most
      uppercase letters) had to be squeezed to fit the space, and others (such
      as i, l, I) had to be modified to fill out more space, as to not cause too
      many gaps in the text. the i the l the I The necessary letter
      modifications resulted in a new genre of monospaced typefaces. They turned
      out to be particularly useful for clearly distinguishing letters, for
      writing data in an orderly manner, and for helping the eye compare lines
      and layout. All of this is still vital when writing and reading code, and
      so this choice of typeface has prevailed in programming until today. I
      began to think about the connections between text and code; letters and
      technology; between typing, writing and coding. But before algorithms were
      written, typed or punched, they were wired. It was women who were tasked
      with figuring out the machine; and by doing so, they invented software
      programming. <img src="image/fig-7.jpg" alt="" /> Betty Holberton, Jean
      Jennings Bartik, Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichterman, and
      Frances Bilas Spence had been previously working as Computers on
      calculating missile trajectories and were recruited to find a way to get
      the ENIAC running, an early electronic general-purpose computer covered in
      switches, cables and valves. The engineers of the machine had not
      considered how its programming would work, and so the ENIAC Six, as the
      women came to be known, had to find it out themselves.
    </p>
    <!-- caption -->
    No one really knew how to program the room-sized machine – the only thing
    that existed were the wiring diagrams representing the physical layout of
    the machine. (...) As programming languages did not yet exist, they then
    physically wired the program by fixing cables and flicking the machine’s
    switches in the sequences they had developed. The positions of those
    switches and cables were the program. By training themselves to program the
    ENIAC, they invented and developed major computing concepts which are still
    widely used by programmers today, such as nested loops for example.
    <!-- caption -->
    <p>
      However, despite their doubtless pioneering innovations and the
      significant importance of their intellectual work, they were not credited.
      Instead, they were often portrayed either more as the computer’s mechanics
      or pretty photo models hired to pose in front of it.
    </p>
    <!-- caption -->
    When the ENIAC was finally unveiled to the public in 1946, there was no
    mention of the women who made it run and effectively invented modern
    programming. A 1946 New York Times article announcing the “amazing machine,”
    only credits the male inventors John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. (...)
    the ENIAC Six (as the women who programmed the ENIAC became known) were
    almost erased from history.

      After decades of suffering disregard, they have finally started to receive
      recognition in recent years. Punchcards, though not an entirely new
      technology, were adopted from around 1930 to write and store programs and
      data. Punchcards had already been used since the 18th century to operate
      weaving looms and store pattern instructions – another example of a
      traditionally female occupation at the intersection between information
      technology and manual labour.
      <img src="image/fig-8.jpg" alt="" />
      The job of the data typist emerged. This was what code looked like for at
      least half a century: typed and punched, on paper.
      <img
        src="image/fig-9.jpg"
        alt="A punched card (also punch card or punched-card) is a piece of stiff paper that holds digital data represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. Punched cards were once common in data processing applications or to directly control automated machinery.

      This type of data storage transmits data through holes and non-holes,
      through binary logic, on/off, the zeroes and ones that machines
      understand. Of course, this is not how humans process information, so some
      kind of translation needed to happen between human language and machine
      language, between words and calculations. Grace Hopper, a female computer
      scientist, effected a major breakthrough in how machines and humans now
      talk to each other. She thought that code should be written in human
      language.

      Grace Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist known for
      popularizing the idea that programming languages could be independent from
      machines, and that an English-based language was possible. (...) She
      recalls: “(...) It’s much easier for most people to write an English
      statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to
      be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would
      translate them into machine code. (...) I would say ‘Subtract income tax
      from pay’ instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds
      of symbols.” (0) INPUT INVENTORY FILE-A PRICE FILE-B ; OUTPUT PRICED-INV

      Programming today carries her legacy. First and foremost, code is a
      language, with syntax and grammar and vocabulary, plus some logic. We can
      invent code much like a sentence, choosing the words that fit best. Code
      is text both in the sense that it is composed by letters and that it can
      be written and read. When thinking about Hoppers legacy, language and the
      readabilitiy of code, one might ask: Who actually reads the code? In the
      case of this website, I write code for the browser to read, interpret,
      execute. The browser is my audience. And not only does it speak a
      different language, it has a wholly different way of reading. Did you know
      that spaces take browsers just the same time to read as actual letters?
      Every glyph typed – even if it is a blank space – results in information
      stored, and corresponds to storage space or file size. This is why proper
      programmers storetheircodewithoutspaces. The absence of a letter is not
      nothing, blank space not 0. The only humans reading the code I write is
      myself and possibly other coders working on it with me, who are likely
      already tuned into conventional abstractions and lazy shortcuts. Go to
      your favourite website, right click, inspect the code. Can you read what’s
      going on? We thought – but then how could code be written as humanly
      readable as possible, even for those who don’t code? Please right click

      is both functional to browsers and readable to humans leads to many
      inefficient workarounds and plenty of failure, because without keeping
      some symbolic and syntactical conventions, browsers would quite simply not
      understand. But maybe try it, climb all the way up, then travel down and
      go inside.

      I hope it becomes clear how the code was written hand in hand with its
      design and named by its content; a conceptional attempt – ambitious and
      doomed – to place central emphasis on being able to navigate the website
      just based on its source code, even through the non-coder’s eye. The
      letters in code are data and thus stand purely for the information of
      which symbol is used. But this information is manifested as letters of a
      certain shape; they are not only read but seen, too. Every text needs a
      typeface. This text, this code, this website needed a typeface.

      Early typewriters usually came with one typeface built right into the
      machine. The introduction of changeable typefaces moved the typewriter one
      step closer to becoming a modern productive word processor and precursor
      of today’s desktop computers. The IBM Selectric, released in 1961, was one
      of the first machines where fonts could be switched easily and characters
      could be stored on a magnetic band, making it thus an important bridge
      technology between typewriter and computer.

      Dual Basic was one of the many typefaces available for the Selectric. I
      liked the typeface for its openness and clarity; also, it lacks the usual
      modifications done on monospaced typefaces to fill visual holes. It is
      almost like a text typeface only with equalized widths; it seemed like an
      interesting in-between, unsure of which technology or age to belong to.

      I found that in my investigation into all this, the harder I looked, the
      blurrier the lines became between coding, writing and typing. Might the
      distinction between them be simply determined by my choice of typeface and
      machinery? For coding, I use a code editor and a monospaced font, because
      it is easier for reading text that is code. For writing, I use a
      proportionally spaced typeface, because it is easier for reading text that
      is not code. In both cases, I press buttons, I type. The typeface you are
      reading and seeing now is Coda, designed as part of this project. It is
      based on the framework of Dual Basic and modified in two directions: In
      one, whitespace is taken out, and the monospaced becomes proportional,
      much nicer for reading this text right now. In the other direction,
      fictional serifs are added, to transform it into a fully functional coding
      typeface. Every letter and every way a letter’s line is made, drawn,
      chiseled or printed has a historical and technological provenance. Today,
      typefaces are produced digitally; they are software, they are code, thus
      themselves written and composed of text. We can think about variables,
      interaction, output. Code is text is type is font is code?

      Let me tie at least one of many loose ends here. You may rightfully
      wonder: what happened to women programmers? Why is the image we have of a
      programmer today automatically, reflexively, that of a man? I have
      mentioned the wage discrimination that had been structurally present from
      the moment women entered the modern workforce. There was also an
      unwillingness by computer companies to provide models of work that would
      help to balance childcare with a career. And as computing developed into
      an increasingly important and profitable industry, the image, value and
      requirements of the profession changed profoundly. A conference held in
      1968 to address the so-called “software crisis” (a consequence of
      programming’s difficulty to keep up with ever accelerating technological
      progress) initiated a movement to re-brand programming as “software
      engineering.” What sounds like a merely semantic change would however come
      to have far-reaching implications, determining who could gain access to
      the field and who couldn’t.

      Women faded from the profession. They were never truly gone, but harder to
      be found. There were still women where networks were formed; hypertexts
      created; knowledge organised; search engines built; message boards hosted;
      connections drawn... But the landscape of computing, and the idea of what
      it represents and how it’s represented, changed to such an extent that
      female contributions were in many parts forgotten. This is of course an
      incomplete history, told subjectively through the lens of Katrins and my
      research, the books we read, the course of our conversations, personal
      interests and own experiences. I never had or knew of female programmer
      role models. The suggestion to code my own website and not use Geocities
      for the homepage of my email writing club came from my stepfather, a
      software engineer, and sparked my fascination with what pure text can
      create. Though off to an early start, programming was never in the realm
      of what I considered for my professional future, because I simply never
      knew that someone like me could be doing something like that. It took me a
      long time to realize that if I wanted to see it, I needed to be it – or at
      least try to. I am happy to see more women, now; again. This research has
      been instrumental in discovering somewhat of a 1ineage.

      This is the structure of the web’s native tongue, a programming language
      called HTML. It is especially prone to endless fractal-like nesting of
      elements inside and alongside one another. Structures are built with a
      syntax that wraps, creates vessels, holds, embraces, stacks, plunges,
      births. Thus, web code knows words and concepts of inheritance and
      ancestry. :first-child, :nth-child(n), :last-child, children,
      childrenNodes, siblings(), nextSibling, parentNode, parent(), parents(),
      parentsUntil(), gparent(), just to name a few. This is what it looks like:

      Thankfully, we do not write code on empty sheets of paper anymore. We use
      code editors; fancy text programs that do all kinds of things to help find
      our way in the matrix. There, lines have proven to be the most efficient
      crumbs for finding back, connecting beginnings and ends. Looking at our
      digital interfaces, lines often signal traces back to an origin, to the
      first element, post, tweet or email.

      We were also reminded of the warps in fabrics, vertically structuring a
      textile piece that back in the day might have been programmed by
      punchcards, ancestors to the code written here. The lines you can see on
      this website visualise how the code of this website looks in the moment of
      coding it. Its design mirrors its code, shows the process, reveals its own
      making, in a way. Lines have a way of accumulating the more we write, the
      deeper we dig and the longer we go. It means something is building:
      software, patterns, conversations, layers, story. These lines we can
      create ourselves; they make a structure that we can use to crawl in
      between hierarchies and chronologies; and they are the scaffold this
      website, this text, this story builds on.
